A list of privacy tools and no-corp software

--- System ---

LineageOS (https://lineageos.org/) An alternative operating system which requires high skills to install, from what I heard. It's basically Android but usable without a Google account.

Shelter* (https://f-droid.org/de/packages/net.typeblog.shelter/) Creates a second "work" account where you can isolate apps you don't want to use, which can't be uninstall though.

--- Mail ---

Tutanota* (https://f-droid.org/de/packages/de.tutao.tutanota/) Full mail and calendar client and provider. Incredible high focus on privacy, look good, works good. Some features are still in development but free or very cheap in the premium version.

FairMail* (https://f-droid.org/app/eu.faircode.email) Mail client which let's you do, what ever you dream of. It won't win the beauty award but has everything you need.

K-9 (https://f-droid.org/de/packages/com.fsck.k9/) Mail client.


--- App Stores ---

F-Droid* (https://f-droid.org/) The app store which only has FOSS apps. Nice and easy overlay, auto updates for apps, screenshots.

Aurora Droid (https://f-droid.org/de/packages/com.aurora.adroid/) Basically F Droid, just more beautiful.

Aurora Store* (https://f-droid.org/app/com.aurora.store) A Google Play Store App, which let's you use the store without an account. Has an integrated tracking radar which shows the trackers within the apps. I have to use it sometimes to get e.g. banking apps I need.


--- Keyboard ---

AnySoftKeyBoard* (https://f-droid.org/app/com.menny.android.anysoftkeyboard) Open Source solution. Works well after setting everything up.
